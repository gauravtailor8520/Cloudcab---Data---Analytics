## **Code Issues Identified**

### **Critical Bug in load.py**
```python
# Current (INCORRECT) - exports fact_table to all tables
for key, value in data.items():
    table_id = 'uber-data-analytics-438418.cab_data_project.{}'.format(key)
    BigQuery.with_config(ConfigFileLoader(config_path, config_profile)).export(
        DataFrame(data['fact_table']),  # BUG: Always exports fact_table
        table_id,
        if_exists='replace',
    )

# Should be (CORRECT):
for key, value in data.items():
    table_id = 'uber-data-analytics-438418.cab_data_project.{}'.format(key)
    BigQuery.with_config(ConfigFileLoader(config_path, config_profile)).export(
